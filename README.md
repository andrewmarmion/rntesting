## A repo to test CI suites with a react-native project. 

Testing react-native testing. 

This repo is a playground for different testing 

## Travis
Currently running Jest tests on Travis. Detox Test

## CircleCI
Currently running Jest tests on CircleCI

## Bitrise
Currently running Jest tests on Bitrise

## Observations
* Cannot run iOS builds on Circle CI as that requires using the macOS plan which costs.  
* From previous projects, Bitrise CI has timed on the first test suite when doing Detox testing. 
* Bitrise freetrial has expired.

## Todo

* Get Detox working on Travis
* Jenkins
