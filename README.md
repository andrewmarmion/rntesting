Testing react-native testing. 

This repo is a playground for different testing 

## Travis
Currently running Jest tests on Travis.

## CircleCI
Currently running Jest tests on CircleCI

## Observations
Cannot run iOS builds on Circle CI as that requires using the macOS plan which costs.  
From previous projects, Bitrise CI has timed on the first test suite when doing Detox testing. 

## Todo

* Get Detox working on Travis
* Bitrise
* Jenkins
